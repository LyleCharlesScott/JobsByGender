# Jobs by Gender -
## a chart showing data from the Seattle City API

This project is a code challenge for Moz.com, using an angular-seed package to set up.
(https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git)

It's an angularjs app, using Bower and NPM for dependencies, font awesome CSS and bootstrap CSS.

## installation

git clone https://github.com/LyleCharlesScott/JobsByGender/tree/cleanup

Once the repo is installed locally, type

['npm start']

to load both npm and bower dependencies and start a simple development server. Then, navigate to:
[`localhost:8000/index.html`]

The input on the left upper part of the chart controls the number of data items displayed on each page.
The Mars and Venus icons change the data diplay to only show job titles in which men or women earn more,
respectively. The next input field is for filtering the data by minimum difference in hourly wage. Click
on column titles to toggle between ascending and descending column sort. Pagination controls are at the
bottom of the chart.
